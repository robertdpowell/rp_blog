All organisations that deliver products and services to customers are continuously making decisions about how to adapt their product or service to meet the needs of the customer and/or their business.

Continuous change is necessary because:-

*  Customer expectations are continuously changing, based on their experience interacting with other products and services.
*  Advances in technology and/or competition in the market can mean the organisation's value proposition can be better met or more cheaply offered by another company.
*  Organisations need to remain compliant with the changing legal and regulatory landscape they exist in.
*  Our customers tell us we need to change (either directly, or through their actions).

Change is therefore necessary if we want our business to remain viable and relevant.

##### The Cost of Change

The change we choose to deliver always comes at some cost. This cost is both the time, money and resources we throw at the change, and the cost of not investing in other competing change ideas.

Organisations therefore need to be careful to back the changes that will deliver the best results for them.


##### Discovery

Discovery is a range of techniques that an organisation can adopt in order to:-

* Discover problems worth solving for our customers and our business
* Discover solutions to those problems that we are confident enough in to spend our organisations resources on.

<br>
<br>

##### First, discover the problem
We always make change in order to solve a particular **problem** in order to achieve some type of **outcome** that is important for our business. (examples).

Organisations need to decide which problems to tackle in which order so as to deliver against the business outcomes.

In order to discover the problems, we need to spend time with the users of our product or service to understand them and how our product or service does or does not meet their needs.

##### A Problem Worth Solving?
 Before we start trying to solve a problem, we first need to ensure that it truly is a problem. How do we know it is a problem? How big of a problem is it? Who experiences the problem? We need to collect evidence so we can say with confidence, 'we know this is a problem for (this group) because of (these evidence-based facts)'. 

This is where good, reliable data about how our product/service is used, becomes invaluable. Dealing in facts and not opinion is imperative when we are deciding whether or not to invest in solving a particular problem. This data also helps us to measure whether or not we have improved the situation after implementing our solution.

##### Getting to Confident

When we are sure we have a **problem worth solving**, we need to **discover a solution** to that problem that we have high enough confidence in to start investing time, money resources in delivering that solution.

Having a high level of confidence in a product or service change means:-

* We are confident that our customers will choose to use our change, because it adds value for them.
* We are confident the solution will be accepted as viable by our business stakeholders (legal, security, commercial, cost etc)
* We are confident that this solution will be usable by our customers
* We are confident that this solution can be delivered technically

(see Marty Cagan's [4 Big Risks](https://svpg.com/four-big-risks/)) 

We want to get confidence across these dimensions **before** we commit to delivering the change.

But how can we get this confidence **before** we deliver the solution?

##### Discovery before Delivery

During Discovery we validate our solution ideas by running tests/experiments, as cheaply as is possible, in order to build up our confidence levels.

We create prototypes, mockups, technical proof of concepts that we put in front of users, business stakeholders, engineers to get feedback and **learn what does and doesn't work**. Based on what we learn, we adapt our prototypes and then test again. We repeat this process until we are sufficiently confident that our solution to the problem is valuable, viable, usable and technically achievable.


##### Continuous Discovery

Discovery should not be a one-off event. Organisations need to engage in a continuous dialogue with their customers in order to continuously discover problems to solve and solutions to these problems that we have high confidence in.

By doing this, we'll be able to provide a continuous flow of work to our delivery teams.
