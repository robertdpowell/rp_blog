#### Why Change 

All organisations that deliver products and services to customers are continuously making decisions about how to adapt their product or service to meet the needs of the customer and/or their business.

Continuous change is necessary because:-

*  Customer expectations are continuously changing, based on their experience interacting with other products and services.
*  Advances in technology and/or competition in the market can mean the organisation's value proposition can be better met or more cheaply offered by another company.
*  Organisations need to remain compliant with the changing legal and regulatory landscape they exist in.
*  Our customers tell us we need to change (either directly, or through their actions).

Change is therefore necessary if we want our business to remain viable and relevant.

#### The Cost of Change

The change we deliver to always comes at some cost. This cost is both the time, money and resources we throw at the change, and the cost of not investing in other competing change ideas.

Organisations therefore need to be careful to back the changes that will deliver the best results for them.

Product Discovery is a set of techniques that help organisations discover and get confidence in ideas for change, before committing time, resources and effort to deliver them.

As mentioned above, some change is just necessary, it must be done. For example, GDPR or IFRS17 legislation that an organisation simply must comply with.

This article isn't about that type of change.

This article is about the type of change we do have some element of choice over.

#### Start with the problem
We always make change in order to solve a particular **problem** in order to achieve some type of **outcome** that is important for our business. (examples).

Organisations need to decide which problems to tackle in which order so as to deliver against the business outcomes.

Our product discovery work flows from these 'problems to solve'.

#### A Problem Worth Solving?
Before we start trying to solve a problem, we first need to ensure that it truly is a problem. How do we know it is a problem? How big of a problem is it? Who experiences the problem? We need to collect evidence so we can say with confidence, 'we know this is a problem for (this group) because of (these evidence-based facts)'. 

This is where good, reliable data about how our product/service is used, becomes invaluable. Dealing in facts and not opinion is imperative when we are deciding whether or not to solve a problem.

#### Getting to Confident

When we are sure we have a **problem worth solving**, we need to discover a solution to that problem that we have high enough confidence in to start investing time, money resources in delivering that solution.

Having a high level of confidence in a product or service change means:-

* We are confident that our customers will choose to use our change, because it adds value for them.
* We are confident the solution will be accepted as viable by our business stakeholders (legal, security, commercial)
* We are confident that this solution will be usable by our customers
* We are confident that this solution can be delivered technically

(see 4 types of risk, Marty Cagan)

We want to get confidence across these four dimensions before we start the expensive work of delivering the change.

But how can we get this confidence **before** we deliver the solution?

#### Discovery before Delivery

This is where product discovery techniques come in.

Discovery is a way of getting to know 

Product discovery involves validating our solution ideas by running tests, as cheaply as is possible, in order to build up our confidence levels.

We create prototypes, mockups, technical proof of concepts that we put in front of users, business stakeholders, engineers to get feedback and **learn what does and doesn't work**. Based on whart we learn, we adapt our prototypes and then test again. We repeat this process until we are sufficiently confident that our solution to the problem is valuable, viable, usable and technically achievable.

This discovery work is so important, as it prevents us backing the wrong horse. It takes a certain element of risk out of our delivery process as we can be sure that the only changes we are investing our resource in are those that we are truly confident in.
