## KEY CONCEPTS

* A optimal product management approach maximises our chances of discovering then delivering product that **customers actually want** and reduces the risk of delivering product that do not deliver value (after all, life is too short to deliver poor products).

* A serious challenge in delivering valuable products to customers is the process by which the vast majority of companies goes about it. This process seems predicated on some false beliefs.
    1. We know what our customers want (we often don't)
    2. We can accurately provide business case estimates upfront regarding how much it will cost us to deliver the product, and what the return on investment will be (we often can't) 
    3. Most of the initiatives on our roadmap will deliver the outputs that our business needs (most won't)

<br>

* In reality, Cagan challenges, we cannot reliably provide upfront estimes of cost and ROI (how can we know what we don't know?)and most of our ideas will not deliver the outcomes we hoped for. By following such a process we are wasting time and effort that could have been invested in more fruitful initiatives (the opportunity cost).

* The most successful companies are those that look past specific Agile implementations and instead adopt some of the more fundamental principes that underpin these movements. These principles are central to Cagan's recommended approach to product management:-
    1. **Address risk early** - value, usability, feasibility, viability risks
    2. **Define and design collaboratively** - Product Management, UX, Engineering
    3. **Solve problems to deliver outcomes (not outputs)** - how will we know we've been successful?

<br>

*  Cagan boils down his recommended process into two key phases

    1. **Discovery** - where we discover the product to be built by addressing the four types of risk to arrive at ideas worth pursuing, through prototypes.
    2. **Delivery** - where we build and deliver the product ideas we validated in Discovery to achieve product/market fit and deliver against our product strategy.

* Our aim is to achieve Product/Market fit - the smallest amount of product that meets the need of a certain segment of customers


## PRODUCT TEAMS

* "We need teams of missionaries, not mercenaries" - John Doerr.  Mercenaries build what they are told to, Missionaries believe in the vision and apply their skills to solve problems.

* Teams should be given clear objectives and are empowered to deliver against these objectives.
