* **Product development is not analogous to manufacturing** - tasks are (mostly) highly variable and not predictable. Adopting a factory approach to product development is counter-productive.

* Product quality decreases when resource utilisation is pushed close to 100% by management. **Managers don't appreciate the negative impact of high utilisation**.

* High utilisation leads to queues which affect economic performance. Due to the nature of the work, it is difficult to observe queues and product work inventory - there are no physical signs. 

* Better to provide a **capacity buffer** in processes that are highly variable - e.g. Google 20% days. Easy to say, not so easy to implement!  Better to target teams and managers on productive outcome rather than high resource utilisation.

* A **reduction in active work** can help to sharpen focus, as can **making WIP visible**. **Reducing batch size** cuts WIP and speeds up feedback which improves cycle time, quality and efficiency.

* Batch size should strike a good balance between **transaction costs and holding costs**. In software/product development, this is the difference between large batches of code every few months to testing smaller batches a few times a day.

* Product work is highly variable and so trying to obstinately follow a plan is not appropriate. Plans should be treated as **hypotheses** that are subject to **continuous evolution as we continuously learn**.

* **Less can be more**. 'Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication' - Leonardo da Vinci.

* Problem definition is the hardest and most important part of the innovation process. **Invest time here** as it sets good context for everything that follows.

* Users usually want a solution that **'just works'**. 

* The push to 'get it right first time' should be replaced with a **tolerance of 'getting it wrong first time'**. Getting it wrong early is cheaper than finding a problem much later on when the cake is almost baked.

* **Product development is not analogous to manufacturing!**
