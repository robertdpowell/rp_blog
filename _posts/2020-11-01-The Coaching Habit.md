## COACHING QUESTIONS

*  "What's on your mind?"

*  "And what else? Is there anything else?"

*  "What's the real challenge here **for you?**"

*  "Just so I'm clear, How can I help?"

*  "What else could you do?"

*  "What was most useful here **for you?**. 

*  "What did you learn? What was your most useful insight? What do you want to remember? What did you find most useful about this chat? (reinforce the learning moment by asking them to generate the answer)

*  "Imagine a miracle occurred overnight - how would you know that things are better? What would be different?"

## NOTES

*  Leaders and managers are often too 'busy' to invest time in helping their team members grow. But making individuals become more **self-sufficient** can help to prevent you from having to jump in and become the bottleneck. 

*  Being busy is no measure of success - quite the contrary. **Being busy is a form of laziness**.

*  Coaching is ultimately about **helping others** and unlocking their potential.

*  Coaching is an **essential leadership behaviour**. Leaders who can coach are the foundation of a strong, 21st century organizational culture.

*  Coaching for performance differs from coaching for development. The difference between focussing on &&**putting out the fire** and focussing on **the person putting out the fire**.

*  You want people that you interact with to be engaged, not in retreat

*  **Don't dive in** and fill the silence!

*  Increase the [TERA](https://www.growthcoaching.com.au/articles-new/4-ways-to-build-safety-in-the-coaching-relationship?country=au) quotient  

*  Restrain yourself from being the **Advice Monster**.

* **The Drama Triangle** - Victim, Persecutor, Rescuer.  Each is an ineffective state to be in and can lead to the 'working-too-hard' habit.

* Rescuers feel like they are helping but actually are **limiting opportunities** for others to expand their potential.

* Stay curious and listen to the answer! Less advice - **more curiosity!**

* **Avoid TBUs!** True But Useless phrases.
