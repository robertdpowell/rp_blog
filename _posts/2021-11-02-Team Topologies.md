- Much has been written about the design of software, but little has been written about the design of the software organisation.

- This book is all about team structure and modes of interaction

- As a system gets more complex, so does the cognitive load of the teams working to support and evolve it.

- System design should cater for loose coupling and optimal flow.

##### Chapter 1

- Building systems is a team activity.

- Treat people and technology as a 'single human/computer carbon/silicon sociotechnical system'.

- Don't rely on the org chart to help understand how to split the work. Instead put in place long-lived, decoupled teams. Org charts and the strict communication channels they imply, don't represent reality. 

- In order to get work done, lateral (or horizontal) communication is necessary.

- We need to map out the actual communication patterns between teams and individuals, within our organisations.

- We should optimise team design for delivery of value to customers.

- Systems thinking - look at the whole ---> Find the biggest bottleneck --> Eliminate it.
