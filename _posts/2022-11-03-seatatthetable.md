- CIO should lead enterprise in seizing opportunities to create business value through technology.

- We have locked ourselve into a frame of reference that hinders agility (e.g. projects).

- The business value of IT is the intangible asset of the Enterprise Architecture, which has immediate value and latent value.

- IT delivery is about making incremental adjustments to that asset.

- We need to promote a different approach to uncertainty and risk.

- Enterprises are Complex Adaptive Systems, which we need to navigate through with an inspect-and-adapt, feedback-driven approach given the complexity.

- Software is pliable, allowing us to test our assumptions at relatively low cost.

- A CIO should guide the enterprise in its use of technology and information assets.

- IT and the business relationship characterised by 'arms-length, contractor, command-control model'. No part of the enterprise should be at arms length!

- IT is the business. The business it IT.

- The essence of Agile: 
    - We should inspect and adapt frequently rather than slavishly following a plan.
