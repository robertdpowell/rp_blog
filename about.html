          Robert Powell studied his Masters in Computer Science at the University of Glamorgan, 
          where he achieved a distinction in 2011. While studying, he worked as a Business Analyst 
          and then Project Manager for an international education organisation. During this time, he discovered the
          limitations of traditional requirements gathering approaches and waterfall project delivery. This experience led 
          him to explore the disciplines of product management and agile.
          <br>
          <br>
          10 years later, Robert now manages the CI-CD platform team at a global financial services organisation. His team are
          responsible for providing the organisation's development teams with a platform that allows them to release their software change
          from development to production in a highly automated, consistent manner.
          <br>
          <br>
          In this role, he is able to apply the agile, product management and service design practices he believes in to continuously improve the 
          the platform service for its users.

          I built <a href="https://tweetsinwelsh.com">tweetsinwelsh.com</a> as an experiment to see to what extent 
          I could improve my Welsh reading skills and vocabulary through 
          daily translation of a bitesize piece of everyday Welsh.
          <br>
          <br>
          The site gained quite a following through 2020, with visitors from all over the world every day, 
          using the site to support their own Welsh learning.
          <br>
          <br>
          These days I tend to post a new translation once or twice a month, rather than every day.
          <br>
          <br>
          Below are some nice things people said about this project.

              It is brilliant resource, and a fantastic idea to encourage people to develop language 
              skills through translating Tweets. I enjoy and value using it. 
              It amazes me that a resource like this does not exist for more languages!"
