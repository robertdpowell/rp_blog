<h5 id="foreword">Foreword</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Much has been written about the design of software, but little has been written about the design of the software organisation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This book is all about team structure and modes of interaction</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a system gets more complex, so does the cognitive load of the teams working to support and evolve it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>System design should cater for loose coupling and optimal flow.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Building systems is a team activity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Treat people and technology as a ‘single human/computer carbon/silicon sociotechnical system’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t rely on the org chart to help understand how to split the work. Instead put in place long-lived, decoupled teams. Org charts and the strict communication channels they imply, don’t represent reality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to get work done, lateral (or horizontal) communication is necessary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to map out the actual communication patterns between teams and individuals, within our organisations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should optimise team design for delivery of value to customers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Systems thinking - look at the whole —&gt; Find the biggest bottleneck –&gt; Eliminate it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Three types of team structure - Formal, Informal, Value Creation. This book focuses on last two.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conway’s law - Organisations are constrained to produce system designs that are copies of the communication structure of the organisation. Because this is what the communication channels allow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>High cognitive load on teams prevents mastery attainment and increases context switching costs, introduces delays and quality issues. A team becomes the bottleneck.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put the team first! Restrict cognitive load and design the inter-communications patterns between them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An organisation organised into functional silos is unlikely to produce systems architected for fast flow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By shaping the communication paths, we can avoid Conway’s law.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“If we do not want a single shared database, or separate front end and back end tiers, 
we need to think again about our organisation design”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider what software architecture we desire before designing our teams.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need a team-first architecture designed for people to work with it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Technical people need to be involved in organisation design.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Identify where communication is happening when it shouldn’t be - what is driving that? What gap is there?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speed of software delivery affected by the number of team dependencies the organisation design dictates.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fast flow means restricting communication.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fracture plan patterns split code up into separate parts that can live in separate repos and can be worked on by different teams.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reverse Conway - our architecture is a reflection of the communication patterns of our org. So, if we want a different architecture, design teams and interaction patternd to match the intended architecture. DBA example.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="chapter-3---team-first-thinking">Chapter 3 - Team first thinking</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Google research - who is on the team matters less than the team dynamics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Team - ‘Stable grouping of five to nine people who work toward a shared goal as a unit.’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Work should be assigned to teams, not individuals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maximise trust by limiting team numbers. Trust allows us to innovate and experiment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dunbar’s number.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Brook’s law.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teams then own software and should think in multiple horizons. Ownership is key. Every part of the system should be owned by one team.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every part of the software should be owned by one team only.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to manage the cognitive load of each team carefully.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cognitive load - the total amount of mental effort being used in the working memory - Sweller, 1998.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Intrinsic cognitive load can be minimised through training, good choice of technology, hiring etc., extraneous cognitive load should be eliminated or automated, leaving us room for germane cognitive load.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider number and complexity of domains as a means of assessing your team’s cognitive load. Amount of context-switching is an important factor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a domain is too big for a single team, break the domain down.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Communicate goals and outcomes, not worrying too much about the ‘how’. Eyes on, hands off.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minimize cognitive load for others is an important heuristic for good software development.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Define team APIs that include code, documentation and user experience - helping other teams understand how to interact with us</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>API-based, separation of concerns between teams. Try not to share code bases between teams.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Office design an important consideration for communication flow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“you start seeing things from other people’s viewpoints when you sit with them.”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="chapter-4---static-team-topologies">Chapter 4 - Static Team Topologies</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We need consciously designed team structures - team topologies. We need to explicity design our organisation to meet our goals. Don’t just copy the Spotify model.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Question we should ask ourselves: Given our skills, constraints, maturity, desired architecture and business goals, which team topology will help us deliver results faster and safer? How can we reduce or avoid handovers between teams?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Older organisational models - functional silos, heavy outsourcing, repeated hand offs between teams.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want our software development teams to be set up for fast flow, minimal hand-offs and rich operational feedback flowing directly to the team.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accelerate - “We must ensure delivery teams are cross-functional with all the skills necessary to design, develop, test, deploy and operate the system on the same team.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no one right topology for any organisation, but many wrong ones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Feature teams. Product Teams.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Being dependent on other teams to get your work done is bad because other team’s have their own priorities and it is difficult to synchronise priorities across teams.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Key for teams remaining autonomous is for external dependencies to be non-blocking. Self-service capabilites accessible on demand (easily consumable, platform-oriented), is often how this is done.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avoid hard dependencies with functional teams like infra and QA.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Example - cloud team might own the provisioning process to ensure controls are in place, but product team should be able to provision the resource themselves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Organisation size (or software scale) and engineering maturity should influence which topologies are chosen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before throwing more people at existing teams, consider instead which dependencies we want to break between existing teams.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Look at knowledge, task and resource dependencies between teams and identify where they can be reduced.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need an evolutionary path from where we are now, to where we want to be to realise organisational expectations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From DevOps team to ‘DevOps Evangelist Team’. Get the team to own the automation themeselves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t make your DevOps team a dependency - focus on building self-service tools.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="chapter-5---four-fundamental-team-topologies">Chapter 5 - Four Fundamental Team Topologies</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Reduce number of team variations. We could focus on just four to reduce ambiguity (Jiao Luo)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Combine these four with effective software boundaries and team interactions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no ops team - there is no live operation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h6 id="stream-aligned-teams">Stream-Aligned teams</h6>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Aligned to single valuable stream of work (product, service, user journey..)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The primary team type. All other teams are there to reduce the burden on the stream-aligned teams.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most teams will be stream-aligned. Ratio of 6:1 or 9:1</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are close to customers and close to prod. They monitor in prod.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Team is funded in a long-term sustainable manner.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“You build it, you run it” - Werner Vogels, CTO Amazon</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Team ideally contains some generalists and some specialists. Specialists means bottlenecks!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We use the term ‘stream’ as a stream should flow unimpeded. It is a more widely applicable term than ‘product’ or ‘feature’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minimal hand-offs to other teams.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h6 id="enabling-teams">Enabling teams</h6>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Composed of specialists in a domain</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have bandwidth to research and make suggestions on tooling, frameworks, practices in response to the challenges being experienced by the stream aligned teams.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘Technical Consulting Teams’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bring solutions to problems being experienced by stream aligned teams.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not a permanent dependency but support for a focused, temporary period.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Areas of speciliasm might be continuous delivery, test automation, containerisation, where the enabling team sets up a walking skeleton of a pipeline or test framework.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stays ahead of the curve in their area of expertise</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘Engineering enablement’</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h6 id="complicated-sub-system-teams">Complicated sub-system teams</h6>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Build and maintain part of system that requires specialist knowledge but is needed by many of the stream teams.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only expect a few.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Work by the sub-system team should be delivered in line with the needs of the stream teams.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h6 id="platform-teams">Platform teams</h6>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Delivers internal services to reduce cognitive load on stream teams.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evan Bottcher definition</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thick platform vs thin platform.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Examples - server provisioning, access management and security enforcement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘Platform as a product.’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Possible to have inner topologies within a platform team.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Need to focus on UX and DevEx.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Need a feeback loop.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Product roadmap driven by personas.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h6 id="avoiding-silos">Avoiding Silos</h6>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We should avoid dedicated teams of specialists as it creates hand-offs that disrupt flow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead create cross-functional stream-aligned teams supported by the other topologies.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h6 id="conversions">Conversions</h6>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Infrastructure teams to Platform Teams</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Component teams to Platform or other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tool teams to Enabling teams.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Support teams per stream/area.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Architects to part-time enabling team. Supporting and enabling, not dictating.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="chapter-6---chose-team-first-boundaries">Chapter 6 - Chose Team First Boundaries</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Need to find suitable team boundaries to encourage flow</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Align ownership of software to capabilities of a single team.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many problems come from unclear boundaries between teams.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We don’t want a ‘distributed monolith’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘JOINED AT THE DATABASE MONOLITH’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use service mocks to test and deploy independent APIs in isolation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enforcing standardization leads to less experimentation and learning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Colocate by purpose, not just colocate bodies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Look for fracture planes in our software - natural split points to break up the monolith and support team autonomy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could align software with business domains - see DDD. Align biz and tech on terminology.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could split based on regulatory needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could split by change cadence allows teams moving at different speeds to not be impeded by each other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could split by team location (efficiency of communication)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could split by risk profile.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could split by perfomance isolation need.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could split by tech (not advised, but maybe needed with a legacy app which cannot work with modern tools)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could split by persona (teams managing features needed by a certain persona)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Could we consume or provide this subsystem as a service?”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="chapter-7---team-interaction-modes">Chapter 7 - Team Interaction Modes</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Collaboration or X-as-a-Service or Facilitation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Want to avoid that all teams need to communicate with each other. Intermittent communication is best.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provides clarity for teams.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Key point is to choose between two teams collaborating and one team consuming something as a service from another team.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Collaboration</strong> - (two teams working closely together) needed when needing to pool skillsets of more than one team, perhaps when exploring a new innovation or technology and discovery/rapid learning needed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A need for ongoing collaboration indicates incorrect team boundaries or skill mix</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Collaboration comes at a cost and needs tangible rewards. ‘Collaboration tax’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Collaboration mode should be activated with only one other team at a time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>High trust and mutual collaboration</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>X-as-a-service</strong> - ‘when it needs to just work’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clean API and/or boundary between teams.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>DevEx should be highly compelling</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Less innovation possiblity than Collaboration mode, as API/interface clearly defined and locked down.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Emphasise the user experience</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Needs people with strong product and service management expertise</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Facilitating</strong> - main mode of an enabling team.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Help ensure the quality of interactions across teams is good.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Promise theory - Mark Burgess.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Help and be helped</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>needs people with strong mentoring and facilitating experience</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Collaborate on ambiguous interfaces until they are proven and stable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Role of architects to help define these boundaries as interfaces.</p>
  </li>

<h5 id="chapter-8---evolve-team-structures-with-organisational-sensing">Chapter 8 - Evolve Team Structures with Organisational Sensing</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The deliberate change in team interaction to enhance delivery capability is the essence of strategic technology leadership</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Key point - team topologies should evolve and we can set target states we aim to achieve with a plan to get there, learning as we go.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Typical evolution pattern - Collab(discovery)–&gt;Limited Collab –&gt; X-as-a-service (predictable delivery).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do we know when to evolve?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>software or domain too large for team, leads to individuals on the team becoming specialists in certain products and then single points of failure/bottlenecks</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>delivery cadence is slowing down</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>many teams rely on large set of underlying services</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need telemetry to sense when things are not going well</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Treat Ops as an input to dev</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep ops at least aligned to the same value stream as dev.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Separate maintenance/BAU teams work against reponsiveness.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The 4 team types is all that is needed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The team is the fundamental unit of delivery.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Switch from technology first to team/communication first approach to org design.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Team structures must match the required system architecture.</p>
  </li>
  <li>How to get started:-</li>
  <li>Start with the team</li>
  <li>Identify streams of change that will be supported by all other teams</li>
  <li>Identify a TVP</li>
  <li>Identify gaps in non tech requirements (coaching, mentoring, service management, documentation). Not just about technologists.</li>
  <li>Explain it to people! Team first approach, Conway’s law, interaction models.</li>
